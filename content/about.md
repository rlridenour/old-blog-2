## About Me ##




I am an associate professor of philosophy at [Oklahoma Baptist University](http://www.okbu.edu). As one of only three people in the department, I teach a number of different courses. Courses that I teach regularly are Introduction to Philosophy, Critical Thinking, Political Philosophy, Philosophy of Language, Metaphysics, and Aesthetics. My past research has been on the nature and justification of religious belief, the relation of religious belief to ethics, the role of mystery in religious belief, and the problem of religious tolerance. My most recent work is on the effects of social media on community.

I am also a chaplain in the United States Army Reserve. My service includes tours at Ft. Hood, Texas, Ft. Sill, Oklahoma, a deployment to Iraq in 2007, and a deployment to Afghanistan in 2013.

I enjoy experimenting with technology, spending more time trying out text editors than writing. Currently, I use a combination of Emacs and Sublime Text, and do my writing in LaTeX. 

This blog will feature posts from all of my interests&mdash;religion, philosophy, and technology.

I live in Norman, Oklahoma, with my wife, Sheri. We have one daughter, Rachael, who is married to her husband, Josh.
