Different uses of the concept.

## Cultural and Personal ##

|          | Function                                | Substance      |
| :---     | :----                                   | :----          |

* Assumes laws
* World of observation and world of abstract concepts
* Scientific method

# Psychological Theories

## Psychoanalysis

* Freud, writing 1900 — 1930
	* Two levels: cultural and personal
	* Cultural
		* Subdue antisocial tendencies to selfishness and aggression
		* Helps society to operate smoothly
	* Personal
		* Unconscious core is pleasure seeking
		* Ego and superego repress expression of these motivations
		* Religion serves the ego and superego
		* Religion keeps inappropriate social behaviors in check
		* Led to tendency to neurosis by suppressing natural motivations
		* Healthy person can accommodate needs and social restraints
		* Unhealthy person suffers psychological conflict
	* Jung
		* Ego psychology
		* Emphasizes part of mind that satisfies unconscious desires and guides person to do so in socially acceptable ways.
		* Mind contains built-in universal ideas that motivate people to seek their real-world counterparts.
			* Mother, for example
		* God is an archetype, an unconscious reality
		* Humans born with tendency to search for and find God.
	* Rizzuto
		* Object relations theory
			* Emphasizes mental representation of God and person's relation to that representation.

## Attachment Theory

* Attachment of child to caregiver formed early
* Varies in type and quality
* Type and strength will determine whether people gravitate toward belief in God later
* Three types: secure, insecure, avoidant
* Secure —— child orients to caregiver, is comforted. Feels safe and secure.
* Secure: least likely to experience religious conversion
* Insecure: need a safe haven, search for loving God.

## Uncertainty-Identity Theory

* Too much uncertainty upsets stability, which disturbs sense of identity
* Religion provides a sense of who you are.
* Uncertainty is part of life
* Too much is stressful
* Cope with stress by joining group
* Group provides identity
* Can create boundaries between individuals and other groups.
* Extreme: dehumanization of other groups

## Need for Meaning
* Victor Frankl: *Man's Search for Meaning*
* Nazi concentration camp
* Fundamental motive is a search for meaning
* Fulfilled only by something outside self
* Unconscious need for transcendence
	* Religious, loved one, cause
	* Anything other than self will do
	* Best in life is selfless, not selfish

## Attribution Theory
* Attribution is inferred
* Common-sense attributions
	* People who believe that God is active in world are more likely to say that something is God's will
* Paradoxical attributions
	* Adults who were victims of religiously motivated abuse as children are more likely to see God as involved int heir upbringing.

## Neurological Cognitive Substrate

* Region is a brain function
* Tibetan Buddhists and Catholic nuns
	* Same brain event
	* Meaning of experience reported differently

## Cognitive Anthropomorphism

* We engage with nonhuman world the same way we engage with humans
* Makes sense of things we don't understand

## Cognitive Structures

* Religion is a way of processing information and making sense of the world.

## Cognitive Processes

* Human cognition system has some flexibility
* Flexibility is important
* We take the idea of human, make small changes, create idea of God
* Naturally occurs
* Objection, doesn't explain why people believe

## Group Selection

* Religion gives survival benefit, not needed in every member of the group.

## Big Gods

* Need a way to hold people accountable as society grows.

## Cultural Psychology

1. A religion can be considered a culture. Both constructs include notions of shared values, norms, symbols, and practices that define the group and the expectations for members. 
2. Members of a religion and members of a national or ethnic group may be one in the same, as when all people in a country follow the same beliefs. In such cases, we cannot separate the effects of the religion from the effects of the national or ethnic aspects.
3. The shape that a religion takes may result from the culture in which it happens to be placed.
4. A religion and the larger culture may interact to produce unique effects that would not otherwise appear.

# Logic and Methods #

* How do we know what we think we know?
* How do we formulate good questions?
    * Many methods, each has its strengths.
* Two axes
    * Individual and group
    * Qualitative and quantitative
* Qualitative
    * Biography, interviews, observation
    * Interpret the meaning of raw material, often interviews
    * Tendency to be subjective
    * Need to control for bias of the researcher
        * Have several independent analyses
* Quantitative
    * Self-ratings or other measurable behaviors 
* Need both
* Preventing bias
    * Bias can be in both procedures and interpretation
* Bias from religious differences in population and psychologists
    * Americans in general are twice as religious as psychologists
    * Ashiq Ali Shah and Sebastian Murken in "From Conflict to Dialogue" in *The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion*, 2002

## Measuring Religious Variables ##

* We don't measure religion
* We measure particular variables
    * Number of times a person went to church during a period
    * Reported degree of satisfaction with a church
    * Blood flow, brain activity

### Simple identification approach

* Ask people what they believe and do
    * Place data in category
    * Strengths: easy, versatile
    * Weaknesses: can be misleading, imprecise categories
        * Example: different churches count membership in different ways

### Factors and Scales

* 66 good measuring tools
* Criteria
    * Conceptual clarity
        * Clear idea of what is to be measured
    * Sample representativeness
        * Clear about what sample the tool is designed for (religious and non-religious groups, religious groups only, etc.)
    * Cultural sensitivity
        * Measures appropriate to the meaning of religious language in the culture
    * Sustained research program
        * Can stand the test of time
    * Alternative to self-report and simple category
        * Only used when simple identification approach would fail
* Recent progress in scales to measure international and multi-cultural religion

## Research Methods ##

* Need to state the question clearly
* Describe the goal precisely

### Lab Experiments ###

* Most precise
* Closest to cause-effect conclusion
* Manipulate the independent variable
* See if a change occurs in the dependent variable
* Example: does thinking about religion have emotional effects?
    * Give people a list of non-religious words to read, followed by a list of religious words
    * Measure pulse-rate, respiratory rate, skin capacitance. See if there is a change
* Controlled experiment
    * Subjects randomly assigned to two groups
    * Experimental group gets suspected cause
    * Control group does not
    * Test if there is a difference in the level of the effect in the two groups
    * Blind experiment: subjects don't know which group they are in
    * Double-blind: the experimenter also does not know which group the subjects are in
    * Very hard to do in the context of religion.
        * Example: does conversion result in a greater sense of satisfaction with life?
            * Can't randomly select people to be converted
        * Example: does prayer cause healing?
            * Can't be sure the control group is not being prayed for

### Surveys ###

* Survey is procedure
* Questionnaire is instrument
* Measures what people claim
* Does not measure actual behavior

#### Issues ####

* Surveys are samples
* Population: whole group you are studying
* Sample: subset of the population
* A good sample is 
    * Not too small
    * Not biased
* A sample is representative if it matches the population in every respect
* A sample is random if every member of the population has an equal chance to be included in the sample.
* Random samples are more likely to be representative than non-random samples
* Bad surveys
    * Self-selected
    * Ignore order effects
    * Ask slanted questions
* Margin of error: the range from the survey result that the right answer could be in
    * If N is the sample size and the population is very large, then the margin of error at the 95% confidence level is roughly \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\)
