## Psychoanalysis

* Freud, writing 1900 — 1930
	* Two levels: cultural and personal
	* Cultural
		* Subdue antisocial tendencies to selfishness and aggression
		* Helps society to operate smoothly
	* Personal
		* Unconscious core is pleasure seeking
		* Ego and superego repress expression of these motivations
		* Religion serves the ego and superego
		* Religion keeps inappropriate social behaviors in check
		* Led to tendency to neurosis by suppressing natural motivations
		* Healthy person can accommodate needs and social restraints
		* Unhealthy person suffers psychological conflict
	* Jung
		* Ego psychology
		* Emphasizes part of mind that satisfies unconscious desires and guides person to do so in socially acceptable ways.
		* Mind contains built-in universal ideas that motivate people to seek their real-world counterparts.
			* Mother, for example
		* God is an archetype, an unconscious reality
		* Humans born with tendency to search for and find God.
	* Rizzuto
		* Object relations theory
			* Emphasizes mental representation of God and person's relation to that representation.

## Attachment Theory

* Attachment of child to caregiver formed early
* Varies in type and quality
* Type and strength will determine whether people gravitate toward belief in God later
* Three types: secure, insecure, avoidant
* Secure —— child orients to caregiver, is comforted. Feels safe and secure.
* Secure: least likely to experience religious conversion
* Insecure: need a safe haven, search for loving God.

## Uncertainty-Identity Theory

* Too much uncertainty upsets stability, which disturbs sense of identity
* Religion provides a sense of who you are.
* Uncertainty is part of life
* Too much is stressful
* Cope with stress by joining group
* Group provides identity
* Can create boundaries between individuals and other groups.
* Extreme: dehumanization of other groups

## Need for Meaning
* Victor Frankl: *Man's Search for Meaning*
* Nazi concentration camp
* Fundamental motive is a search for meaning
* Fulfilled only by something outside self
* Unconscious need for transcendence
	* Religious, loved one, cause
	* Anything other than self will do
	* Best in life is selfless, not selfish

## Attribution Theory
* Attribution is inferred
* Common-sense attributions
	* People who believe that God is active in world are more likely to say that something is God's will
* Paradoxical attributions
	* Adults who were victims of religiously motivated abuse as children are more likely to see God as involved int heir upbringing.

## Neurological Cognitive Substrate

* Region is a brain function
* Tibetan Buddhists and Catholic nuns
	* Same brain event
	* Meaning of experience reported differently

## Cognitive Anthropomorphism

* We engage with nonhuman world the same way we engage with humans
* Makes sense of things we don't understand

## Cognitive Structures

* Religion is a way of processing information and making sense of the world.

## Cognitive Processes

* Human cognition system has some flexibility
* Flexibility is important
* We take the idea of human, make small changes, create idea of God
* Naturally occurs
* Objection, doesn't explain why people believe

## Group Selection

* Religion gives survival benefit, not needed in every member of the group.

## Big Gods

* Need a way to hold people accountable as society grows.

## Cultural Psychology

1. A religion can be considered a culture. Both constructs include notions of shared values, norms, symbols, and practices that define the group and the expectations for members. 
2. Members of a religion and members of a national or ethnic group may be one in the same, as when all people in a country follow the same beliefs. In such cases, we cannot separate the effects of the religion from the effects of the national or ethnic aspects.
3. The shape that a religion takes may result from the culture in which it happens to be placed.
4. A religion and the larger culture may interact to produce unique effects that would not otherwise appear.
