**What is religion?**

Different uses of the concept.

## Cultural and Personal ##

* How does this function in a person's life?
* Give meaning
* Provide code of ethics
* Gives one truth to believe
* What do you personally believe, and how does it function in your life?
* What does it do to and for you?
* How does it affect what you do, your health, etc?
* Cultural 
* Social institution
* Religion in culture may not be the same as in the individual.

## Function and Substance ##

* Functional role of religion
* Substantive definition says what is believed is important.

|          | Function                                | Substance      |
| :---     | :----                                   | :----          |
| Personal | Serves religious purpose                | Unique beliefs |
| Social   | Performs religious function for society | Formal creed, public stance |


## Sacred ##

* Religion is a search for significance in ways related to the sacred
* Significance: something that matters
* Sacred: Something that is set apart for some reason
* Circular definition: a person's religion is whatever they say it is.

## Dimensions of Religiousness ##

* 1927-1967: no work in psychology of religion
    * Scientific or religious
    * Competition for clients

## Barbour's Model of Science and Religion ##

1. Conflict
2. Parallel
3. Dialogue
4. Integration

## Psychology as a Science ##

* Assumes laws
* World of observation and world of abstract concepts
* Scientific method

# Psychological Theories

## Psychoanalysis

* Freud, writing 1900 — 1930
	* Two levels: cultural and personal
	* Cultural
		* Subdue antisocial tendencies to selfishness and aggression
		* Helps society to operate smoothly
	* Personal
		* Unconscious core is pleasure seeking
		* Ego and superego repress expression of these motivations
		* Religion serves the ego and superego
		* Religion keeps inappropriate social behaviors in check
		* Led to tendency to neurosis by suppressing natural motivations
		* Healthy person can accommodate needs and social restraints
		* Unhealthy person suffers psychological conflict
	* Jung
		* Ego psychology
		* Emphasizes part of mind that satisfies unconscious desires and guides person to do so in socially acceptable ways.
		* Mind contains built-in universal ideas that motivate people to seek their real-world counterparts.
			* Mother, for example
		* God is an archetype, an unconscious reality
		* Humans born with tendency to search for and find God.
	* Rizzuto
		* Object relations theory
			* Emphasizes mental representation of God and person's relation to that representation.

## Attachment Theory

* Attachment of child to caregiver formed early
* Varies in type and quality
* Type and strength will determine whether people gravitate toward belief in God later
* Three types: secure, insecure, avoidant
* Secure —— child orients to caregiver, is comforted. Feels safe and secure.
* Secure: least likely to experience religious conversion
* Insecure: need a safe haven, search for loving God.

## Uncertainty-Identity Theory

* Too much uncertainty upsets stability, which disturbs sense of identity
* Religion provides a sense of who you are.
* Uncertainty is part of life
* Too much is stressful
* Cope with stress by joining group
* Group provides identity
* Can create boundaries between individuals and other groups.
* Extreme: dehumanization of other groups

## Need for Meaning
* Victor Frankl: *Man's Search for Meaning*
* Nazi concentration camp
* Fundamental motive is a search for meaning
* Fulfilled only by something outside self
* Unconscious need for transcendence
	* Religious, loved one, cause
	* Anything other than self will do
	* Best in life is selfless, not selfish

## Attribution Theory
* Attribution is inferred
* Common-sense attributions
	* People who believe that God is active in world are more likely to say that something is God's will
* Paradoxical attributions
	* Adults who were victims of religiously motivated abuse as children are more likely to see God as involved int heir upbringing.

## Neurological Cognitive Substrate

* Region is a brain function
* Tibetan Buddhists and Catholic nuns
	* Same brain event
	* Meaning of experience reported differently

## Cognitive Anthropomorphism

* We engage with nonhuman world the same way we engage with humans
* Makes sense of things we don't understand

## Cognitive Structures

* Religion is a way of processing information and making sense of the world.

## Cognitive Processes

* Human cognition system has some flexibility
* Flexibility is important
* We take the idea of human, make small changes, create idea of God
* Naturally occurs
* Objection, doesn't explain why people believe

## Group Selection

* Religion gives survival benefit, not needed in every member of the group.

## Big Gods

* Need a way to hold people accountable as society grows.

## Cultural Psychology

1. A religion can be considered a culture. Both constructs include notions of shared values, norms, symbols, and practices that define the group and the expectations for members. 
2. Members of a religion and members of a national or ethnic group may be one in the same, as when all people in a country follow the same beliefs. In such cases, we cannot separate the effects of the religion from the effects of the national or ethnic aspects.
3. The shape that a religion takes may result from the culture in which it happens to be placed.
4. A religion and the larger culture may interact to produce unique effects that would not otherwise appear.

# Logic and Methods #

* How do we know what we think we know?
* How do we formulate good questions?
    * Many methods, each has its strengths.
* Two axes
    * Individual and group
    * Qualitative and quantitative
* Qualitative
    * Biography, interviews, observation
    * Interpret the meaning of raw material, often interviews
    * Tendency to be subjective
    * Need to control for bias of the researcher
        * Have several independent analyses
* Quantitative
    * Self-ratings or other measurable behaviors 
* Need both
* Preventing bias
    * Bias can be in both procedures and interpretation
* Bias from religious differences in population and psychologists
    * Americans in general are twice as religious as psychologists
    * Ashiq Ali Shah and Sebastian Murken in "From Conflict to Dialogue" in *The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion*, 2002

## Measuring Religious Variables ##

* We don't measure religion
* We measure particular variables
    * Number of times a person went to church during a period
    * Reported degree of satisfaction with a church
    * Blood flow, brain activity

### Simple identification approach

* Ask people what they believe and do
    * Place data in category
    * Strengths: easy, versatile
    * Weaknesses: can be misleading, imprecise categories
        * Example: different churches count membership in different ways

### Factors and Scales

* 66 good measuring tools
* Criteria
    * Conceptual clarity
        * Clear idea of what is to be measured
    * Sample representativeness
        * Clear about what sample the tool is designed for (religious and non-religious groups, religious groups only, etc.)
    * Cultural sensitivity
        * Measures appropriate to the meaning of religious language in the culture
    * Sustained research program
        * Can stand the test of time
    * Alternative to self-report and simple category
        * Only used when simple identification approach would fail
* Recent progress in scales to measure international and multi-cultural religion

## Research Methods ##

* Need to state the question clearly
* Describe the goal precisely

### Lab Experiments ###

* Most precise
* Closest to cause-effect conclusion
* Manipulate the independent variable
* See if a change occurs in the dependent variable
* Example: does thinking about religion have emotional effects?
    * Give people a list of non-religious words to read, followed by a list of religious words
    * Measure pulse-rate, respiratory rate, skin capacitance. See if there is a change
* Controlled experiment
    * Subjects randomly assigned to two groups
    * Experimental group gets suspected cause
    * Control group does not
    * Test if there is a difference in the level of the effect in the two groups
    * Blind experiment: subjects don't know which group they are in
    * Double-blind: the experimenter also does not know which group the subjects are in
    * Very hard to do in the context of religion.
        * Example: does conversion result in a greater sense of satisfaction with life?
            * Can't randomly select people to be converted
        * Example: does prayer cause healing?
            * Can't be sure the control group is not being prayed for

### Surveys ###

* Survey is procedure
* Questionnaire is instrument
* Measures what people claim
* Does not measure actual behavior

#### Issues ####

* Surveys are samples
* Population: whole group you are studying
* Sample: subset of the population
* A good sample is 
    * Not too small
    * Not biased
* A sample is representative if it matches the population in every respect
* A sample is random if every member of the population has an equal chance to be included in the sample.
* Random samples are more likely to be representative than non-random samples
* Bad surveys
    * Self-selected
    * Ignore order effects
    * Ask slanted questions
* Margin of error: the range from the survey result that the right answer could be in
    * If N is the sample size and the population is very large, then the margin of error at the 95% confidence level is roughly 1 divided by the square root of N.

# Developmental Processes #

## Models ##

* Children are involved in religion in ways that have lifelong consequences.
* Outcome depends on parents


### Ancient Wisdom ###

Proverbs 22:6, "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it."

## Child Religious Development ##

* Children are not adults
* Minds do not work like adults'.
* May not mean the same thing by religious words.
* Ideas are hung on words. Adults have many words, children only a few.
* Questions children ask
    * Does God die like everyone else?
    * How does God pick up the dead people?
    * How old is God?
* View prayer as a tool.
    * "Next time I'm going to pray before I throw the dice!"

### Stages of Religious Concepts ###

1. Fairy-tale stage (3-6)
2. Realistic stage (7-12)
3. Individualistic stage (13-18)

Why was Moses afraid to look at God?

1. Because God had a funny face
2. Because it was a ball of fire or bright light.
3. Because God is holy and the world is sinful.

Prayer

* Children asked about prayer
* Global, undifferentiated stage (5-7)
* Concrete, differentiated stage (7-9)
    * Uttering requests
* Abstract, differentiated stage (11-12)
    * Conversation with God

## Learning and Socialization ##

* Learning is based on reward, punishment, reinforcement, imitation and modeling.
* Attachment theory
    * Children need haven of safety and secure base

## Interdependence ##

* US and China on origin of the world
* US, 8-10, prefer creation
* China, uniformly evolution
* Views about soul
    * Children apply it to plants, furniture
    * Mennonite children did not.
* Parenting styles
    * Authoritarian
        * Demanding, not responsive 
    * Authoritative
        * Demanding and responsive
    * Permissive
        * Not demanding, responsive (give in to children)
    * Rejecting
        * Neither demanding nor responsive
* Authoritative parenting has greatest chance of developing socially responsible children.

## Youth ##

* Peers
* Increased mental ability
* Individuation and identity
* Doubt

### Kohlberg ###

Story: druggist charging ten times (2,000 dollars)for medicine than it costs to make. Woman will die without the drug. Druggist refuses to sell it for the 1,000 dollars that her husband has raised. Husband breaks in and steals the drug. Was he right?

Stages:

1. Punishment and obedience stage
2. Instrumental relativist orientation
    1. Right and wrong are determined by reward
3. Interpersonal concordance (good boy)
4. Social system maintenance
5. Social contract orientation
6. Universal ethical principles

## Lifespan Models ##

## Stages of Faith Development ##

1. Primal, Undifferentiated Faith
    2. 0-2 years, foundations of hope, trust, loyalty made with relationship to caregiver. Mistakes here create foundation of mistrust and lack of faith.
2. Intuitive–Projective Faith
    3. 3-7, tendency to imagination 
3. Mythic–Literal Faith
    4. 7-11, lessons and moral rules taken literally, greater understanding.
4. Synthetic–Conventional Faith
    5. 12 and up, many factors influence life, faith synthesizes all of those factors. Gives identity.
5. Inductive–Reflective Faith
    6. Reaction to tensions, critically self-reflective, development of unique individual identity and worldview. May begin late adolescence to 30's or 40's.
6. Conjunctive Faith
    7. Development of epistemological humility. Start to reject exclusive dichotomies in certain contexts. Begins before midlife if at all.
7. Universalizing Faith
    8. See beyond human categories, feel a oneness with ultimate reality. 

### Data

* 88% of children 0-6 were in stage 1.
    * 12% transitioning to stage 2.
* 7-12, 72% at stage 2.
    * 17% transition to 3, 10% still in 1.
* 13-20, 50% at stage 3.
    * 29% transition to 4.
* 21-30, 40% at 4.
    * 33% at 3-4
    * Smaller percentages at surrounding stages.
* 31-40, 38% in stage 3.
* 41-50, 56% in stage 4.
    * 9% in 3
    
### Assessment

* Heavily cognitive, ignores practice and behavior.
* No attention to personality.
* Ignores life events.

## Faith Styles ##

* Evidence shows that at early stages of faith development, subjects think that one has faith or fear, not both. Decisions are eternal or temporal but not both.
* Later stages tend to see both ends at the same time.

# Religion in the Individual #

* Adults should show coherence in traits, attitudes, values, goals, and sense of self.
* A person  who had a clear developmental path should function as a integrated whole, not set of dissociated, separate parts.
* Internally consistent meaning system is key

## The Whole Person ##

* The religious person is involved in the processes of 
	* Believing
	* Bonding (emotions and attachments)
	* Behaving 
	* Belonging

### Psychology of the Whole Person ###

* Three levels of interdependent processes: core traits, goals, identity and worldview

### Traits ###

* Dispositions
	* Kind, extrovert, etc.

### Midlevel Functions ###

* Goals, purposes, values
* Goals can be short term and specific or long term and abstract.
* Much of religion is at this level.

### Identity and Worldview ###

* Self-identity: how you define yourself.
* Factors that determine how you understand and interpret reality.

### Self as Construct ###

* The self is made, not found.
* The self you are today is not the same as yesterday.

## Traits ##

* Five-factor model
	* Openness to experience
	* Conscientousness
	* Extroversion
	* Agreeableness
	* Neuroticism
* A sixth, spirituality, has been suggested.

## Spiritual Intelligence ##

* Ultimate Concern: things that a person holds in absolute or hightest importance.
* Spiritual Intelligence: the ability to define goals and purposes that are part of UC and act to move towards UC.

# Conversion #

* People convert in large numbers
* People also deconvert

## Background ##

* Most stay with the religion of their upbringing.
* US – 30% switch from one religion to another.
* 10-20% deconvert, claim no religion.
* When adults change to another religion or to none:
	* 40% say that a major reason was the teachings of the religion.
		* 25% say this was a minor reason
	* 33% say they found a religion that was more fulfilling.
		* 15% – minor reason
	* 50% say change due to dissatisfaction with the local church.
	* 50% say change due to leaders struggling with each other over control.
* Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism are missionary religions.
* In US, half of very religious people think it is necessary to bring others into the religion.
	* For 6%, the goal is to convert the whole society, so it conforms to their beliefs and practices.
* Conversion best seen as a process.
    * Intellectual, moral, and social conversions.
    * Intellectual: change in belief.
    * Moral: change in attitude to behavior.
    * Social: change in attitude to social environment.
    
## Agency ##

* Is conversion active or passive?
    * Active: by choice
    * Passive: by psychological processes.
* Answer: both.

## Speed ##

* Are slow changes conversions?

## Spiritual Transformation ##

* Change in religion
* Change to no religion
* Change in level of commitment.
* Change in specific element of religion.
* Change in goals of religion.

## How Meaning System Changes ##

* Inputs: doubts and social influence
    * Doubts may be caused by observed hypocrisy, etc.
* Effects: beliefs, attitudes and values, goals, purposes, self-identity and worldview, ultimate concerns.
* Outputs: Belief change, small or big

### Elements ###

* Need
* Doubt
* Context and resources
* Elimination of barriers
* Implementation

## Conversion Types ##

* Sudden
* Gradual
* Religious socialization (can't remember not believing the faith.)

## Individual Factors ##


* **Secularizing exit**: Termination of (concern with) religious belief and praxis and, eventually, disaffiliation from organized religion 
* **Oppositional exit**: Adopting a different system of beliefs and engaging in different ritual practices, while affiliating with a higher tension, more oppositional religious organization, which could mean, for example, conversion into a fundamentalist group 
* **Religious switching**: Migration to a religious organization with a similar system of beliefs and rituals and with no, or only marginal, difference in terms of integration in the surrounding culture 
* **Integrating exit**: Adopting a different system of beliefs and engaging in different ritual practices, while affiliating with an integrated or more accommodated religious organization 
* **Privatizing exit**: Disaffiliating from a religious organization, eventually including termination of membership, but continuation of private religious belief and private religious praxis 
* **Heretical exit**: Disaffiliating from a religious organization, eventually including termination of membership, and individual heretical appropriation of new belief system(s) or engagement in different religious praxis but without new organizational affiliation
