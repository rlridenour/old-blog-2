<!-- Courses that I teach regularly are Introduction to Philosophy, Critical Thinking, History of Philosophy (Ancient, Medieval, Early Modern and American), Political Philosophy, Philosophy of Language, Existentialism, Metaphysics, and Aesthetics. -->

<!-- My research has been on the nature and justification of religious belief, the relation of religious belief to ethics, and the role of mystery in religious belief. My recent work is on the problem of religious tolerance, the effect of social media on community, and the the role of religion in counterinsurgencies. -->

<!-- I recently retired as a chaplain in the United States Army Reserve after thirty-three years of service. My service includes tours at Ft. Hood, Texas, Ft. Sill, Oklahoma, and deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. -->
