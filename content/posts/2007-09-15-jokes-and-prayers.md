<p>Thanks for the jokes. So far, they have come from my sister, Rhonda, and her husband, Mark. I'm not sure I can use the Quaker jokes. I might offend any Quakers in the unit. On the other hand, I suppose there aren't many good Quakers in the Army, it being a  pacifist tradition...</p>
<p>As you can see from one of his responses below, he is asking for prayer for my sister as she undergoes medical tests. I would appreciate your passing this prayer request to others.</p>
<p>One of the lectionary texts for tomorrow is 1 Timothy 1:12-17. The passage ends with this verse: "To the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory       forever and ever. Amen."</p>
<p>May it be so.</p>
