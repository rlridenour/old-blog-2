Voice of Heaven,

Words become thoughts,  
thoughts, beliefs,  
and beliefs, actions;  
and that which I   
once merely heard  
is soon that which I am.

So, help me ignore  
the voices that inspire  
hatred and misery,  
distress and malice,  
selfishness and fear,

May I again hear the   
words of love and joy,  
peace and kindness,  
generosity and hope;

And by hearing,  
learn to speak,  
and by speaking,  
learn to sing with the  
Father, Son, and Spirit.

Three distinct voices,  
in one beautiful song.

*Amen*
