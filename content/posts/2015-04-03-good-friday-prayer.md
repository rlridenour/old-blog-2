Tiny gold crosses  
hang from sparkling  
gold chains,  
signs of  
wealth, affluence,  
and good taste,  
compared to   
a large wooden cross  
covered in blood,  
an instrument of torture,  
a symbol designed  
to bring terror  
to enemies of the state.

On this day, Lord,  
give me a vision  
of the horror of the cross,  
for without it  
there is no beauty  
of the cross.

*Amen*
