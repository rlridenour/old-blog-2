<p>I just finished supper, and have come back to the office. I'm starting a weekly Bible study this week, and we'll have our first meeting for the night shift tonight.</p>
<p>I'm both amazed and amused how soldiers can take something unpleasant and find a way to lift everyone's spirits. For example, I don't know how many of you have had the pleasure of using a Port-a-John that's been sitting in the sun on a 120 degree day. Trust me, there's nothing like that first contact with the seat.</p>
<p>One of the lieutenants has written a parody of that old Johnny Cash song, "Ring of Fire" about the joys of the Port-a-Johns:</p>
<p>"I sat down, down, down, on a ring of fire... a ring of fire."</p>
<p>My problem now is that I can't go into one without humming that song.</p>
