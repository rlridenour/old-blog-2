<p>We just finished a three day exercise that was the last major training event we will have before we leave the states. The hours were long, so everyone is pretty tired. The exercise involves simulations of different scenarios that each section could face. Someone watches your response, and evaluates your actions. For me, the tasks were a suicide threat, a conscientious objector, and responding to some casualties. We did well, but I hope that we don't have to do it in real life.</p>
<p>Pray for peace...</p>
