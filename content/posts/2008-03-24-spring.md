<p>It was a beautiful early spring day in Baghdad today. The high was only 99. Fortunately, we'll be long gone before it gets in the 120's. On a recent trip, I made it within two miles of the ruins of ancient Babylon. Unfortunately, it was too dangerous to visit the ruins. Tradition maintains that the house that Abraham lived in before he left on his journey of faith is at Tallil, which is in southeastern Iraq. One of the sergeants and I are trying to concoct a justification for a trip down there. It's unlikely to happen, though.</p>
<p>Maybe I should just concentrate on going home.</p>
