![Small Tent](/assets/img_0033-tents_small.jpg)

Yesterday was my birthday. We convoyed from our beautiful home in the woods (see picture) to the main part of the base. The soldiers went to practice firing their weapons, and I walked down to the main chapel to pick up some communion supplies. When we got back, I stepped into the tent for a moment, and stepped out into a crowd. Somehow, the soldiers had managed to get a decorated cake out into the field. The box was slightly crushed after the HUMVEE ride, so the decoration said</p>
<p>HAP<br />
BIRTH<br />
CHAPL</p>
<p>Everyone sang, then we cut the cake with a big Gerber knife, and ate cake.</p>
<p>All in all, it's not a bad way to spend one's birthday.</p>
<p>Pray for peace...Yesterday was my birthday. We are currently training at an Army base in the states, but staying in a compound designed to be like a Forward Operating Base (FOB) in Iraq or Afghanistan. We convoyed from our beautiful home in the woods (see picture) to the main part of the base. The soldiers went to practice firing their weapons, and I walked down to the main chapel to pick up some communion supplies. When we got back, I stepped into the tent for a moment, and stepped out into a crowd. Somehow, the soldiers had managed to get a decorated cake out into the field. The box was slightly crushed after the HUMVEE ride, so the decoration said:</p>
<p>HAP<br />
BIRTH<br />
CHAPL</p>
<p>Everyone sang, then we cut the cake with a big Gerber knife, and ate a very good cake. The next morning, I had many messages from colleagues at OBU.</p>
