title: Combat Lifesaver Training

<p>I have survived my three days of combat lifesaver training. The second day was mostly spent learning how to give IV's. On the third day, we had a mass-casualty exercise. Giving someone an IV in a classroom is pretty easy. It's a lot more difficult when the patient is on a stretcher on the ground in the sand as other people are yelling and screaming. My patients survived, though, and don't quite look like human pincushions.</p>
<p>It was good training, but I hope I never have a chance to use it.</p>
<p>This was a difficult week at home. Our house was without power for three days, and the church became a Red Cross shelter. Fortunately, power has been restored at home. Sheri, Rachael, and the menagerie has moved back in. I know that they are glad to be home; I will be too.</p>
