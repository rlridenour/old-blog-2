title: Who Is My God?

Does my God  
love only what I love,  
and hate only what I hate?

If so, then who is my God?

Does my God  
demand nothing of me  
that I don't want to give?

If not, then what value is this grace?

Lead me away from the  
altar of my convenience,   
and teach me once again  
what it means to love you.

*Amen*
