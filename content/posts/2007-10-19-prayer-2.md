<p>The trouble with being a chaplain is that you can't talk much about the details of your work. There are some issues that you could pray for, though. Pray that we will all experience more open communication, find healthy ways to address conflict, and develop renewed attitudes of respect and understanding for each other.</p>
<p>Â Pray also for some time to write a sermon for Sunday...</p>
