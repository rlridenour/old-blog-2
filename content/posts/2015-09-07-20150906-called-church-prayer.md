"Where are you?"

The sound of heartbreak  
rang through the garden  
as the Lord went out  
in the cool of the evening  
to meet his children,  
who hid in the place  
that he gave them,  
a place made for  
fellowship with God.

God still calls,  
and we still hide,  
in places built for  
communion with him,  
masking our shame and fear  
by doing the good while  
failing to hear his call  
to something great.

Father, forgive us.

*Amen*
