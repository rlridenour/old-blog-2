<p>It is September 11, and we took some time out of the day to reflect upon the events that led to our being here. As we did, events happened here that vividly reminded us how fragile our lives are. War and disease both have the consequence of forcing us to rethink our priorities. I am a materialist from a materialistic culture, but the only thing I really want is to go home to see my family again.</p>
<p>Pray for my sister, Rhonda, and her family.</p>
<p>I'm reminded today of an old joke. The preacher said "Everyone who wants to go to heaven raise your hand." One man never raised his. When the preacher asked if he wanted to go to heaven, he replied "Yes, but I thought you were getting a group to go now."</p>
<p>Not yet, Lord, not yet.</p>
