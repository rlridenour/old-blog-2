<p><em>Triumph of the Will</em>, directed by Leni Riefenstahl, is the film that I couldn't remember in Aesthetics this morning. Roger Ebert, in his 1994 <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19940624/REVIEWS/406240302/1023">review</a> of a documentary about Riefenstahl asks exactly the right question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"These are by general consent two of the best documentaries ever made. But because they reflect the ideology of a monstrous movement, they pose a classic question of the contest between art and morality: Is there such a thing as pure art, or does all art make a political statement?"</p>
</blockquote>
