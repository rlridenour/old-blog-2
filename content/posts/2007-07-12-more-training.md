<p>We went to a training area in the middle of the desert for the last three days. It was just a few tents in the middle of the sand. There, we had some classes, the soldiers went to a short-range marksmanship range, and we went on a convoy exercise that had a bunch of IED's, civilians in a town, and other scenarios.</p>
<p>The weather was hot (big surprise, there), and the air conditioning wasn't working in the tents. The training was very good, though. The instructor said three things that were particularly good from a chaplain's perspective:</p>
<ol>
<li>You don't always have to kill somebody.</li>
<li>What you do, you take with you the rest of your life.</li>
<li>Bad news doesn't get better with time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Two good things: We found all of the IED's and we also saw some big herds of camels... Blessings!</p>
