<p>Sheri, Rachael, and  I are spending four great days in Philadelphia. It has sure been nice to spend some time with them and to get away from all things Army. We spent the day today in the Philadelphia Art Museum. They have an excellent collection of Asian art, Medieval art, and an especially nice collection of 20th century art. I was particularly happy to see some well-known works by Duchamp and Mancusi. I'm going to miss teaching Aesthetics next semester.</p>
<p>We also enjoyed visiting the Rodin museum on Sunday, and Independence Hall on Monday. I trust that everyone in the unit is also enjoying their time with family and friends. No one has called, and that's a good sign!</p>
