<p>I am blessed to be a member of a great church, <a href="http://northhavenchurch.net" title="NorthHaven Church">NorthHaven Church</a> in Norman, Oklahoma. The church just moved into a new building, and I'm sorry that I've missed the first Sundays there. I was reading the blog written by my pastor, <a href="http://northhavenchurch.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=40">MitchÂ Randall</a>, and saw a comment left by a new member. She wrote about how she had finally found a home, and I know exactly how she feels. It's a church that celebrates freedom and encourages thoughtful, open-minded exchanges. It's a wonderful place to be, and it will be a wonderful place to go home to when the time finally comes.</p>
