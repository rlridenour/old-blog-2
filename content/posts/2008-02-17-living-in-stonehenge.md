<p>I've been back for a week now, and there have been some changes. One change is that my trailer is surrounded by blast walls that are 12 feet high. These concrete monoliths are all over the country. I can imagine some future archaeologist wondering about the purpose of these great stone artifacts, and debating about whether we would have, given time, reached the sophisticated level of the Easter Island culture.</p>
<p>Two reminders of home today: first, an Air Force captain approached me at breakfast and said that I was his freshman philosophy professor at OBU. It would have been the first year that I was an adjunct there. Second, the Oklahoma National Guard moved into Baghdad. It's good to see the Thunderbird patch again.</p>
