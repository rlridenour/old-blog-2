<p>It was an exciting night last night. I had a Bible study in the office at 2000, and caught the 2100 bus back to my quarters. I live in a trailer pretty close to the edge of the camp. As I was walking from the bus stop through this open area to my trailer, a firefight (Armyese for "gun battle") broke out outside the camp. I walked along watching tracers shoot through the sky in the distance. Then I looked up in front of me and saw two go by right in front of me. I decided then that the best course of action was to run behind a wall, and wait for the shooting to end.</p>
<p>When I got there, I discovered that others had opted for the same course of action. One of my companions behind the wall was a medical officer with the troop medical clinic. He said that, by the time they travel the distance to our trailers, Â the bullets have lost too much velocity to shatter any bones. So, it won't kill you, he said, but they will have to dig it out. I told him that I'd prefer not to get shot at all, even with a slow bullet.</p>
<p>As I was writing this, there were three large explosions from rocket attacks near our offices. I have to say that there has been a lot of progress over the last few months. The number of attacks has really gone down in some areas that had been extremely dangerous. It is still a war, however, and the last two days have been convincing reminders.</p>
<p>Pray for peace, ultimately; and protection in the meantime.</p>
