Another thought-provoking sermon this morning by Mitch Randall​ at [NorthHaven Church](http://northhavenchurch.net/)​.[^1] Nietzsche's main criticism of the church in his day was that it was simply about the world to come, and that a religion that was of no value in this world now was of no value at all — a sentiment articulated in Joe Hill's poem "The Preacher and the Slave":

>Long-haired preachers come out every night,  
Try to tell you what’s wrong and what’s right;  
But when asked how ’bout something to eat  
They will answer with voices so sweet:  
  
>You will eat, bye and bye,  
In that glorious land above the sky;  
Work and pray, live on hay,  
You’ll get pie in the sky when you die....

When Jesus read a Jubilee text from Isaiah in the synagogue at Nazareth, he didn't say that someday this would be fulfilled, but that it was fulfilled "today." 

May it be so, even today.
