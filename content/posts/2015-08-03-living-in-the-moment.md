Lord Jesus,

My mind is filled with  
beautiful memories  
and wonderful dreams,  
thoughts of things that were  
and others that may someday be.  
  
But one eye to the past,  
and the other to the future,  
leaves me blind to this moment;  
thanking you for life,  
while refusing to live it.  
  
May I never forget  
that the Lord of the past and future  
is also Lord in the meantime.  

Amen
