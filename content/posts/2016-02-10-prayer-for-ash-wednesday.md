Holy God,

You call us into the night,  
into the darkness,  
to a place without distraction  
where we can see only ourselves,  
not as we wish we were,  
but as we truly are.

We come hesitantly,  
for we are afraid  
to acknowledge  
what we have become.

We come trembling,  
knowing that hearts  
that are hard  
must somehow be broken.

We come with hope,  
knowing that what  
is broken can  
again be made whole  
by the unending  
love of God.

*Amen*
