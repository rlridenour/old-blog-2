<p>We're leaving tomorrow. We had a great picnic today with the unit and some of the families. Members of my church, NorthHaven Church in Norman, quickly responded to a plea for some funds to finance the meal. We cooked hamburgers, hot dogs, pulled pork, ribs, and chicken. We played volleyball and tossed some horseshoes. It was a great meal and a fun time. Everyone asked me to express their appreciation to the church. It is certainly a blessing and an honor to be a member of a caring community like NorthHaven.</p>
<p>Since the picnic, I've been watching families say their goodbyes. It's easy to see the toll that this war has had on those who serve and their families. Unfortunately, that's just a small part of the suffering that the conflict creates around the world.</p>
<p>It's our last day in the states for a little while. We have turned in our rooms, and will report to the airfield just after midnight. It might be a while before I can make another post. In the meantime, thank you all for your prayers.</p>
