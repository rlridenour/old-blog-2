title: A Funeral Benediction

This is the benediction from a funeral service that I officiated today:

In our blindness,  
may the light of God  
keep us from stumbling.  
  
In our sorrow,  
may the hand of God  
dry our tears.  
  
In our questions,  
may the grace of God  
be enough, until that day  
that we know fully,  
even as we are fully known.  
  
Now, may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,  
the love of the Father,  
and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit  
be with you all,  
now and forever,  

*Amen*
