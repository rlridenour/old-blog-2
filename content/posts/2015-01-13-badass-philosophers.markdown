Best line from a student this week: when I pointed out that women have unfortunately been underrepresented in philosophy, she replied "True, but the ones who are there are real badasses." She said that with more than a bit of admiration and pride.

Anyone who doubts that should read a bit about Elizabeth Anscombe.
