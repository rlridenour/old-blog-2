<p>I had to call the office about a student's grade from last semester. I got to talk to several people back at the university. It was sure nice to hear some voices from home. I also got several messages and pictures from colleagues.</p>
<p>The best, though, is that I now have a working internet connection in my trailer. So, Sheri and I can make video calls through Skype. It's nice to be able to see the person as you speak.</p>
<p>All of that makes this war much different from past ones. The possibility of daily communication is a blessing, but it doesn't always make things better. Once you become used to receiving a call or e-mail every day, then there's a small feeling of panic when you don't get one. Another problem that this creates is the problem of too much information. There are probably some things that happen at home that soldiers don't need to hear, and some things that happen here that families don't need to hear.</p>
<p>Even so, we're not going to give up our video calls!</p>
