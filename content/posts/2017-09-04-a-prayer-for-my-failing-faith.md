God of Hope,

I claim to be person of faith,  
yet live as a person of fear.

I build walls,  
because I fear the stranger;

Hold on to the present,  
because I fear the future.

And make my own plans,  
because I do not trust yours.

What a fool to think   
that what I do out of fear  
could ever be better than  
what you do out of love.

Thanks be to God,  
there is no wall that cannot be torn down,  
no stranger that cannot be a friend,  
and no future that cannot be redeemed.

*Amen*
