On average, twenty-two veterans commit suicide every day.

God of peace,

We pray for those who   
bear the scars of war,  
both visible and invisible,  
for wounds that cannot be seen  
are no less painful to bear,  
and peace is but a distant dream  
when the war is within one's own soul.

Give them the courage to speak,  
and give us to grace to listen.

*Amen*
