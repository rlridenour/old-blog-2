<p>Dale Tuggy has a new <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/trinity/">article</a> in The <em>Stanford Encylopedia of Philosophy</em> on the Trinity. In my opinion, <em><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/">The Stanford Encyclopedia</a></em> is the best reference work in philosophy, not simply the best online reference work in philosophy. I’ve been slowly working on a paper on the Trinity, so I’m grateful to have a nice summary of recent work on the subject. </p>
