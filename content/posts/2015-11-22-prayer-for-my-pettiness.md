Father,

I'm surrounded by voices  
telling me what I want to hear,  
voices urging me to seek my own good,  
to protect what is mine,  
that my security is more important  
than the needs of others.

Help me, Lord,  
to hear a different message,  
one that challenges me  
to become something  
better than I have been,  
and to dismantle my own petty kingdom  
for the sake of the Kingdom of God.

*Amen*
