<p>I've become a heavy drinker. I always travel with a water bottle in hand; and when I finish that one, I start another. The camp command requires that whenever a soldier becomes a heat casualty (heatstroke or heat exhaustion), the core body temperature must be taken immediately. I'll just say that this involves cutting away the back side of the uniform and putting a thermometer in places that we won't discuss. If that won't drive you to drink, then nothing will.</p>
<p>Thanks for your messages and prayers!</p>
