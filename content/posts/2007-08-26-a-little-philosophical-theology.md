<p>Tim Youmans left a comment to a previous posting, so I had an opportunity to browse over to his blog. I saw a post concerning a major issue in philosophy of religion, and I couldn't help but leave a comment. It was sure nice to get to say something about philosophy. I'm missing the excitement of the first few weeks of class right now. We have our own kind of excitement here, but it's just not the same.</p>
<p>I talked about the joys of technology last time. I'd like to point out that it's great when it works, but really aggravating when it doesn't. Sheri and I spent thirty minutes tonight just saying, "Hello, hello, hello" to each other. Maybe I should opt for some older technology tonight and write a letter.</p>
