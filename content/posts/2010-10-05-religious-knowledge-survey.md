<p><a href="http://www.ethicsdaily.com">EthicsDaily.com</a> has an interesting story about a recent <a href="http://pewforum.org/">Pew Forum</a> survey on religious knowledge in the United States. Jews, Mormons, and atheists/agnostics appear to know more about world religions than American Christians.</p>
<p>For those who would like to test their own knowledge, the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life has provided a <a href="http://features.pewforum.org/quiz/us-religious-knowledge/">short version of the survey</a> that you can take online.</p>
