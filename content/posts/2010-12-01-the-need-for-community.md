<blockquote class="big">In order to give us a precise and clear example of humility in the perfection of love, our Lord took a towel and washed his disciples' feet. So what about you, living entirely on your own, how will you ever discover such humility? Whose feet will you wash? Whom will you care for?</blockquote>

<cite class="big">Basil the Great (330-379 AD)</cite>
