Triune God,

In those times  
that we feel alone,  
lost in the crowd,  
and disconnected  
from those around us,  
we take comfort in knowing  
that at the center of reality  
is an unending community of love,  
and that we, your children,  
have been invited into  
the eternal fellowship  
that is the  
Father,  
Son,  
and Holy Spirit,  
three persons,  
but one God,  
forever and ever.

Amen
