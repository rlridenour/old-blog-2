<p>We have made it back to the place where all of our training began - Ft. Dix, New Jersey. After a few days in Kuwait, we began the long process of clearing customs and awaiting transportation. We landed at Maguire Air Force Base on Tuesday. We had to walk across a lawn to get on a bus that was waiting to take us to Ft. Dix. It was wonderful to smell grass once again. The weather is cool, the trees are beautiful, and all is well. I should return to Oklahoma on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It is a bittersweet time. I can't wait to see my family and friends again, but I'm also preparing to say goodbye to some people with whom I have shared some intense experiences. I have already said goodbye to some, for several elected to stay in Iraq for a time. May God continue to watch over them.</p>
<p>See you soon!</p>
