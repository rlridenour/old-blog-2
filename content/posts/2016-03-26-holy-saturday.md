Gracious Father,

Holy Saturday,  
the day of waiting,  
after all of our  
hopes and dreams  
have been crushed  
by a cruel world  
and a naive idealism  
is forced to succumb  
to a harsher reality.

But even after the   
horrors of Friday,  
the morning sun still  
rose on Saturday.

And we have hope,  
however faint,  
however absurd.

So we wait,  
wait to see  
what Sunday  
will bring.

Amen
