I managed to get a picture on today. Here is a picture of me in front of the office.

<p>I've really become attached to the exterior decorating scheme. I wonder how Sheri would feel about putting sandbags around the house when I get home?</p>
<p>I've also found something that I might put in my office. The last vehicle in a convoy has a sign in Arabic and English that says "Stay back 100 meters or you will be shot." I'm thinking of putting that on the office door during my office hours to cut down on the number of visitors.</p>
<p>Blessings...</p>
