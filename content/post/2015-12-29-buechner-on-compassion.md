<blockquote class="big">Compassion is sometimes the fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It is the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too.</blockquote>

<cite class="big">Frederick Buechner</cite>
