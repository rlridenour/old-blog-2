God of Hope,

I plant this tree in faith,  
trusting in your gracious care.

If such a slender trunk  
can weather the Oklahoma wind,  
then surely we too can weather  
these storms of our own making.

May our roots reach down  
into your sustaining love,  
our branches reach out  
to shelter those in need,  
then reach up to the heavens  
to bid your Kingdom come,  
and your will be done.

*Amen*
