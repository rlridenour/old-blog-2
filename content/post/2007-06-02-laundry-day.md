<p>Today is laundry day! Sheri, my wife, knows that I have never been excited about laundry before. Since we don't have washers at the training FOB (Forward Operating Base), we get to go back to main post to do laundry. At our building there, we also have air conditioning and a good internet connection. So, for the moment, laundry is a good thing.</p>
<p>It's amazing how one's priorities change relative to the circumstances. You find that very small things bring great happiness: running water, toilets that flush, a small piece of chocolate, and waking up at 1:00 in the morning and realizing that you don't have to get up until 4:00.Â  Joy can be found in places you would never expect.</p>
<p>Pray for peace...</p>
