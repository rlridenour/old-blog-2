<p>The picture yesterday looked pretty barren.Â I have to admit, though, that the sunrises and sunsets over the desert were beautiful. I'm preparing a sermon for Sunday on the role of the desert in Scripture. Significant events happened in the desert to Moses, Jesus, and others. Maybe God has things of spiritual significance in store for us.</p>
<p>Pray for peace...</p>
