title: Gun Violence â€” A Prayer

Grieving for the lives lost in Oregon, a   
prayer for World Communion Sunday, 2015:

Merciful God,

At least three while   
we sit in worship,

Eighty today,  
as we rest  
on the Sabbath,

Thirty thousand lives  
lost in a single year.

Some were taken  
by their own hand,  
some by accident,  
still others by strangers.

All were lost in  
brutal acts of violence,  
sacrificed on the altar  
of our rights.

Christ gave up everything  
so that I might have life,  
what am I willing to give up
so that others may live?

Lord, have mercy.

*Amen*
