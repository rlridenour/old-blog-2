<p>I passed a church this morning that had this statement on the sign: "Indifference Not Hate." I'm curious what is meant by this, is it supposed to be a statement of reassurance to the community? "It's not that we hate you, we really just don't care...." Would you rather be hated or simply ignored? At least hate is an acknowledgment of the existence and importance of the other person.</p>
