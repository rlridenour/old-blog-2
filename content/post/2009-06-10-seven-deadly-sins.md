<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Back to the blog after a very long break. Geographers from Kansas State University have mapped out the <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2009/05/12/maps-of-the-seven-deadly-sins/">distribution of the seven deadly sins</a> (</span>lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy and pride) across the United States. Interestingly, Oklahoma appears to be in good shape except for wrath.</p>
