<blockquote>I can't stand your religious meetings.<br />
   I'm fed up with your conferences and conventions.<br />
I want nothing to do with your religion projects,<br />
   your pretentious slogans and goals.<br />
I'm sick of your fund-raising schemes,<br />
   your public relations and image making.<br />
I've had all I can take of your noisy ego-music.<br />
   When was the last time you sang to me?<br />
Do you know what I want?<br />
   I want justice—oceans of it.<br />
I want fairness—rivers of it.<br />
   That's what I want. That's all I want.</p></blockquote>
