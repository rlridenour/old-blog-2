God of Pentecost,

We seek the burning  
bush in the desert  
of our existence,  
never expecting that  
the fire that drew Moses  
might fall from heaven  
into our very own lives.

Holy Spirit, come again  
to a fragmented people,  
so that we may speak   
with one voice of the  
unending love of God.

*Amen*
