The stock at Larry's Mart is getting low. If any groups need a project, we could use some supplies. Here's a list of suggestions:

**Toiletries:**

* Body Wash
* Deodorant
* Shampoo
* Conditioner 
* Razor Blades
* Nail Clippers And Files 
* Bath Sponges
* Shaving Cream
* Eyeglass Cleaner
* Floss
* Foot Powder. 
* Baby Powder
* Lotion
* Q-Tips

**Snacks:**

* Peanut Butter Crackers
* Cheese Crackers
* Various Kinds Of Nuts
* Cereal Bars
* Slim Jims
* Beef Jerky
* Ritz Bits
* Fruit Rollups And Other Fruit Snacks
* Microwave Popcorn
* Chips
* Crystal Light On-The-Go Packages
* Coffee

**Over-The-Counter Medication (Generics Are Fine):**

* Pain Reliever (Tylenol, Motrin, Etc.
* Cold/Allergy Medicine
* Eye Drops

We also could use some new movies for the movie library. We don't need any books. Even without the western romance novels, I have a few hundred books. I could also use some crayons and coloring books for the kids at the clinic. I'll put a picture from our last trip below. If you're interested, send me an e-mail and I'll send you the address.
