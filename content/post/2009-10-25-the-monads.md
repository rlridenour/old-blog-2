From the "<a href="http://tar.weatherson.org/">Thoughts, Arguments, and Rants</a>" blog, here is a link to a band called "[The Monads](http://people.umass.edu/phil511/monads/)" and it's reincarnation, "The 21st Century Monads." No educated person could resist songs with titles like "The Skeptic Song" and "The Missing Shade of Blues." There's even a song expressing the emotional depths of the academic life: "My Paper Was Rejected Again."
