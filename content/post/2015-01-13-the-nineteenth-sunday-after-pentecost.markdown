Here I am, Lord,
asking for just
one more chance.

Why do you continue to use me?
What good am I to you?

I am a
flawed,
broken,
undependable
tool.

One that makes mistakes,
and asks for second chances.

But I hear a gentle voice
whispering a message of hope,
that my heart longs to hear...

That even a flawed and broken tool
can make something beautiful
when it's used by the master.

*Amen*
