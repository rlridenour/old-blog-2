Gracious God, Giver of life,

Long ago,  
a tree was planted by your grace  
and watered by your providential care.

It was robbed of  
life and beauty,  
and used to fashion a cross  
to bear body of the Christ,  
broken for our redemption.

And so, Lord, like that tree,  
we have been planted,  
watered, and have grown,  
yet the time has come for us  
to offer our lives to you,  
not just to bear,  
but to become  
the body of Christ  
in this world.

*Amen*
