The first week of a break from classes is always a good time for a massive reconfiguration of something tech-related. Last time it was the blog, this time it is Emacs. Since I primarily use Emacs only for LaTeX and Markdown editing, I though I would give Kieran Healy's [*Emacs Starter Kit for the Social Sciences*](http://kieranhealy.org/resources/emacs-starter-kit/) a try. He has done a masterful job of setting up a great LaTeX editing machine. Easy to install, and easy to customize.
