<p>Six months ago today, we reported to Ft. Dix, New Jersey for training. Now we can start counting down! Tomorrow is Veterans Day. People nationwide will remember to thank veterans for their service. This year, remember to also thank their families. The burdens they are asked to carry can be unbearable sometimes. If you happen to see my family tomorrow, give them a hug, and tell them it's from me.</p>
