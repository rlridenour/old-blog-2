On Friday night, August 11, torch-bearing white nationalists marched on the University of Virginia campus in Charlottesville — chanting Nazi slogans and giving the Nazi salute. At a rally the following day, members of the crowd were seen wearing white nationalist, Nazi, and Ku Klux Klan symbols.[^1] Counter-protesters gathered to respond, and three people had died by the end of the day.[^2]
