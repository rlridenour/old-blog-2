Lord Jesus,

You invite us  
to lay down our  
burdens, cares, concerns,  
fears, and anxieties,  
and give them all to you.

Then, wrapped in the  
sweet warmth of your grace,  
we can dance in joy  
before the throne,  
as beloved children  
of the Father  
who have finally  
found their way home. 

*Amen*
