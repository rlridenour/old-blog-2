<p>It's travel day today. We got to the airfield just after midnight, and the plane left at 4:30 AM. We had a stop to refuel in Canada, then flew to Germany. I got to see icebergs from the plane as we left Newfoundland. It's now 4:15 PM EDT, but just after 9 PM local time in Germany. The weather is nice and cool in both Newfoundland and Germany. We're wondering what the contrast will feel like when we reach our final destination. Everyone is in good spirits and ready to move on.</p>
<p>Thanks for the prayers!</p>
