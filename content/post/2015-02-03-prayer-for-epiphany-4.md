<!-- Sunday's sermon focused on the story of the Gerasene demoniac in Luke 8. In the spirit of the sermon's emphasis on reaching out past our differences, I added a link to one of my favorite renditions of the Isaiah 11 passage, Will Bullas' "Peaceable Kingdom with Two Olives." -->

Jesus,

You found a man living in a cemetery,  
bound by chains that he did not forge,  
forced on him by people who were afraid.

I, too, am bound in chains,  
some forged by ignorance,  
every link a failure to recognize  
your image in another human.

Others forged by arrogance,  
of thinking that there are those  
not fit for your kingdom,  
or for your service.

Still others forged by fear,  
the fear of rejection,  
the fear of difference.

You who created the world  
in all of its diversity  
and declared it to be good,

Free me from the arrogant presumption  
of thinking that I would have done better.

*Amen*
