![Lamb of God](/img/2017/lamb.jpg)

(Painting: *Lamb* by Francisco Zurbarán)[^1]

The sounds of Passover  
fill the streets with  
desperate bleating  
as all the animals   
must be dragged  
to play their  
sacrificial roles.

All, that is, save one  
who goes quietly  
with determination,  
strength, and purpose.

Lamb of God  
have mercy on me.

*Amen*
