<p>We made it to our destination, finally. It has taken some time to set up computer access, which is why this post is late. I need to post some pictures sometime so that you can see the difference between Baghdad and Kuwait. We have trees! I won't talk about specific details of any operations, but I can tell you that the place that I am staying is quite safe. Thanks for all of your prayers, and I'll let you know soon about the ministries that I will be starting.</p>
<p>By the way, I met a Navy CBF chaplain today!</p>
<p>Praise the Lord for safe travel!</p>
