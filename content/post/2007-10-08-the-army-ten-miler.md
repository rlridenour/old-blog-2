<p>The Army Ten-Miler was held Sunday in Washington. It is the largest ten-mile race in the world; 26,000 were expected to run. Thirty military amputees ran the race, calling themselves the "Parts Missing in Action" group. A great testimony to the perserverance and strength of will of the American Soldier.</p>
<p>We had an official ten-miler shadow run here on the base. Seven of us ran, and all seven completed the race. The weather over the past few months has made training a bit difficult, and I've had some runs that were interrupted by explosions.</p>
<p>We know, though, that many have come here with the ability to run, and have had that taken from them in this conflict. We may be feeling a little pain today, but there are much worse pains than a little soreness following a ten-mile run.</p>
<p>May God strengthen those who are determined to run again.</p>
