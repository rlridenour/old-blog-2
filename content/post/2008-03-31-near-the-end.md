<p>We have made it to our last full week in Iraq. I was never very interested in prophecy about the future, but lately I have been thinking a lot about eschatology, or the study of last things. Today, I thought about the last time I will change the sheets on the bed here, or the last time I do a PT run down "Sniper Alley." I wonder if today is the last time that the rockets come in, but given the way things are in Basra right now, I somehow doubt it. I did start working on my last sermon today, titled "Lessons from my Babylonian Exile." When I figure out what those lessons are, I'll let you know. </p>
