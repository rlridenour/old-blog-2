<p>I baptized someone in the 7:00 service this morning. It's an exciting time in the life of a small congregation, and a good reminder that God continues to work in the lives of people, even here. I have to confess that it was a baptism by sprinkling; a hard thing for a professor at a Baptist college to admit to having done. It's a good thing I teach philosophy and not Christian Doctrines.</p>
<p>Pray for Nikki and her new life in the Kingdom of God.</p>
