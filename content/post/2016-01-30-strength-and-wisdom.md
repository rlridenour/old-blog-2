A prayer after a week in which I had made prior commitments for four straight evenings following the thirty hour trip back from Ghana:

Grant us, Lord,  
the strength and energy  
to do those things   
that we've agreed to do,  
and the wisdom to know  
when to agree to something  
in the first place.

Amen
