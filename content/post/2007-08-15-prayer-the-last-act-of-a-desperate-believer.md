title: 'Prayer: The Last Act of a Desperate Believer'

<p>War has probably always presented a good opportunity to reinvigorate one's prayer life. There are some large mosques nearby, and if you are out at the right time, you can hear the call to prayer very clearly. I've decided to use the sound of gunfire as a call to prayer. Several times a day, I hear gunfire from somewhere outside the walls, and try to say a prayer for those on both sides of the conflict, and also for those who are caught in the middle.</p>
<p>Life goes on at home for the families of our soldiers, and things happen, both the good and the bad. When the bad things happen, people struggle with feelings of helplessness. They want to be home to help fix things, but feel helpless here.  At those times, there's nothing left to do but cry and pray together.</p>
<p>May God remind us, as we remind each other, that prayer need not simply be a last act of desperation.</p>
