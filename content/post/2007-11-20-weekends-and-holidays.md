<p>Abraham Lincoln said, "I sincerely wish war was a pleasanter and easier business than it is, but it does not admit of holidays." We have worked through Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day, and will work through Thanksgiving and Christmas. My last day off was during the four-day pass that we had in late June. There are occasional feelings of terror and frequent times of hilarity, but the most common emotional state here is simply weariness. The soldiers still find ways to have fun. Several were planning a parade for Thanksgiving Day involving a small ATV that we have and some balloon animals. We'll see how that works....</p>
