God of joy,

A cacophony of voices  
demand our daily attention,  
some calling us to  
the bitter resignation  
of despair, others, to the  
sweet, but empty, vanity  
of self-righteousness.

Joy, though, speaks with  
a quiet and unassuming voice,  
much like a babe born  
to poor parents and  
laid in a manger to sleep.

Cleanse my heart  
of the cynicism that  
blocks the empty noise  
of the season,  
at the expense  
of the possibility   
of hearing the joy  
of Advent.

*Amen*
