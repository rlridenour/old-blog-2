title: The Fear of Risk

Gracious God,

We live in fear  
of failure and  
disappointment,  
afraid that we  
might say or do   
the wrong thing.

Paralyzed by risk,  
we simply do nothing  
and remain silent.

But who am I,  
blind as I am,  
to judge what does   
or does not fail?

Help me to trust in you,  
the one who makes all things   
work together for good,   
for, to, and through  
those who love you.

*Amen*
