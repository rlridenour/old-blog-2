title: Favorite Bad Amazon Review

This is now my favorite 1-star book review on Amazon. It's a review of *R For Dummies*, a book on the R statistics programing language: 

>If you're looking for a book to explain the letter "R" to you, keep looking, this isn't it.

I hope that person eventually found what they needed.
