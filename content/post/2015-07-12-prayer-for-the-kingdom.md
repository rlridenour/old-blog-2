God of Hope,

My lips say,  
"Thy Kingdom come,  
Thy will be done...,"

But my heart says,

"My will,  
my world,  
and my way."

How can I pray for your Kingdom,  
when I am not yet willing  
to relinquish my own?

Loosen my grip on myself,  
that I may open my arms  
to embrace your vision  
for this world.

*Amen*
