Lord Jesus,

You warned the disciples   
to be wary of claims  
that the messiah had come.  
You said, "When told  
he is in the inner rooms,  
do not believe it."

When Thomas was told   
that you appeared   
in the inner rooms,  
he heeded your word  
and did not believe it  
until he saw for himself.

And of those who claim  
to have special insight  
of your will for us,  
may we be like Thomas,  
the skeptical and  
obedient disciple.

*Amen*
