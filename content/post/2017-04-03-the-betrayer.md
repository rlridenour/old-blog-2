With a kiss,  
Judas gave his Lord  
one last chance to be  
the Messiah of Judas' dreams.

Am I no better than Judas,  
when I twist the words of the Lord  
and manipulate them for my own purposes?

Willing to betray the Lord,   
and for what?

Not even thirty pieces of silver.

Lord, have mercy.

*Amen*
