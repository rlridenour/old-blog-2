![Carrying the Cross of Christ](/img/2017/cross-mosaic.jpg)

(Mosaic: *Carrying the Cross of Christ* by Gabriel Loire)[^1]

It is a sign   
that we cannot  
really understand   
what it means  
for God to die,  
that we remember  
this day when  
truth and beauty   
hung upon a cross  
and we call it good.

What our minds cannot comprehend,  
our words cannot express.

So, we can do nothing  
but stand in silence  
before the glory  
and the horror  
of the cross.

*Amen*
