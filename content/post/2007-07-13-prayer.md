<p>Yesterday was a slow day. We had a very hard three days at the range, with little sleep. So, we enjoyed a slow day yesterday. I had a prayer meeting last night at 2130 (9:30 pm) and will also have one at the same time tonight and tomorrow. Who said Baptists don't have revivals anymore! Eight people were there, and we had a good prayer time.</p>
<p>Thank you for your prayers. Things are going amazingly smoothly, both for me and for my soldiers. Knowing that people are praying is a great help. So, feel free to join us these next two days as we pray. 9:30 our time is 1:30 in the afternoon Central Daylight Time. Pray for the soldiers, their families, civilians who are affected by the war, and remember to pray for peace.</p>
