I can't find the original source of this blessing, but it's attributed to the Franciscans. It's both powerful and provocative to think of discomfort, anger, tears, and foolishness as blessings.

> May God bless you with discomfort,  
> At easy answers, half-truths,  
> And superficial relationships  
> So that you may live  
> Deep within your heart.  
>   
> May God bless you with anger  
> At injustice, oppression,  
> And exploitation of people,  
> So that you may work for  
> Justice, freedom and peace.  
>  
> May God bless you with tears,  
> To shed for those who suffer pain,  
> Rejection, hunger and war,  
> So that you may reach out your hand  
> To comfort them and  
> To turn their pain to joy  
>  
> And may God bless you  
> With enough foolishness  
> To believe that you can  
> Make a difference in the world,  
> So that you can do  
> What others claim cannot be done  
> To bring justice and kindness  
> To all our children and the poor.  
>   
> Amen
