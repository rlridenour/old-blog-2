<p>Yesterday, I received an anonymous package by campus mail that contained this. I assume it was sent by a student in my Aesthetics class. It's a good example of an adequacy condition for an aesthetic theory â€” any theory that claims that this is good art must be rejected.</p>
<p>What should I do to get even? Maybe we'll have to reinstate those daily presentations.</p>
