A prayer for the First Sunday of Lent:

Father,

The dying tree,   
desperate to stay alive,  
tries to maintain  
the illusion of being  
healthy and full,  
but it cannot  
hide the truth,  
for it saps life from  
everything around it.

Forgive me,  
for I take much  
more than I give,  
and like the tree,  
never truly live.

May these roots  
once again taste  
the goodness of   
your grace, and  
these branches  
be a blessing  
to all that  
I encounter.

*Amen*
