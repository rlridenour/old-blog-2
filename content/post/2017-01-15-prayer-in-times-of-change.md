Gracious God,

We live in a time of change,  
sometimes inspiring and exciting,  
sometimes distressing and frightening,  
but always challenging.

Yet even in the midst of upheaval,  
we can be sure of this:

The Father still loves us,  
the Son still calls us,  
The Spirit still leads us,  
and we must still follow –  

Together,  
one body,  
one faith.

*Amen*
