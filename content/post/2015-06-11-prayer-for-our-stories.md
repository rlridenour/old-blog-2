title: Lives are Stories â€” A Prayer

Gracious God,  
who knows us better  
than we know ourselves,

Forgive me,  
when I quickly judge  
a harsh word,  
or impolite response  
without knowing  
the full story.

Everyone has a story,  
and every encounter  
affects the plot,  
and each moment  
is another opportunity  
to transform the tale  
from hopeless tragedy  
to divine beauty.

*Amen*
