Loving God,  
Source of light in our darkness,  
  
We give thanks for the light of your love  
that shines within us, through us, and around us.  
  
When the darkness threatens to overcome us,  
and we fear that we may lose our way,  
  
When our spirits are broken,  
and we no longer can find hope,  
  
Help us to hear the voice  
that spoke the light into being  
and called it good,  
  
And give us the strength  
to lift our voices with John the Apostle  
and declare unto the world  
that the light still shines in the darkness,  
  
And the darkness has not,  
will not,  
and cannot  
overcome it.  

*Amen*
