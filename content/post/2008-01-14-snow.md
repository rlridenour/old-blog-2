<p>I was surprised to open my trailer door Friday morning and see snow. I never expected to see snow in Baghdad. Evidently, it was the first snow in a century. All the Americans were walking around singing "I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas" or some variation. The Iraqis were just staring. Some of the Iraqis didn't have a word for it; they just called it "white rain." People spoke of it being a sign from God, but I never could find out what they thought it signified. I tried to explain that it couldn't be a sign if it didn't signify something, but I'm not sure they were interested in the philosophical issues.</p>
<p>I've been giving suicide prevention briefings to everyone in the battalion. The suicide rate in the Army is now the highest it has been in at least twenty years. It's a difficult time for everyone. I have one more company to brief, and they are located in the Green Zone. I'll travel there, talk with them, then come back to sign out on leave. I should be home this time next week. That will be the Christmas present that I really wanted this year.</p>
