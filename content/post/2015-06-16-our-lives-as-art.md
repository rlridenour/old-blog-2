Great God of beauty and wonder,

There are days when I wish  
that you had given us  
a blueprint for life,  
with every step  
mapped out in detail,  
and every decision  
already made.

Instead, you gave us  
each a life for a canvas,  
and gifts and talents  
for a palette and brushes,   
the Spirit for our guide,  
and the Son for our model,  
then you sent us out  
into the world to paint.

Now, with the loving eye  
of the great artist who painted  
the night sky with stars,  
help us to create something beautiful  
with you.

Amen
