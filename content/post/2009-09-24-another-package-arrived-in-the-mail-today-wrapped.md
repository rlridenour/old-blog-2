<p>Another package arrived in the mail today, wrapped in tissue paper with my address scrawled in permanent marker. Is it art? Let's consider the theories that are in contention.</p>
<p>Art as mimesis - No human being has eyes like that, so it's a bad imitation.</p>
<p>Art as expression - Surely the artist couldn't have been experiencing the same emotion that I'm experiencing as I look on these. I wouldn't wish that on any human being.</p>
<p>Formalism - What do you really think Clive Bell would say about this?</p>
<p>Institutional theory - Purporting to confer the status of art in this case is conclusive proof that you never had the right to confer such status at all.</p>
<p>I'm standing by my earlier claim: it's still not art.</p>
<p>I hope that sale at the dollar store ends soon.</p>
