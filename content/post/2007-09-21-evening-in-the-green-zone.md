<p>I went to visit some soldiers in the International Zone (otherwise known as the Green Zone) yesterday. It's a very different place to be stationed. The embassy is there, so there are a lot of civilians. It's not an isolated compound like the military bases, so you really feel like you are in an international city, not just an American outpost.</p>
<p>We spent an hour or so playing dominos and relaxing by one of the embassy pools. There wereÂ only a few other people in uniform, so it almost felt like I was not in the Army. It was a very relaxing evening; that is, until we heard the sirens announcing an incoming indirect fire attack. We'll take what we can get, though. Those small moments of peace are becoming more and more precious to us.</p>
<p>Pray for peace...</p>
