<blockquote class="big">

<p>Disciple: "Is there anything I can do to make myself enlightened?"</p>

<p>Teacher: "As little as you can do to make the sun rise in the morning."</p>

<p>Disciple: "Then of what use are the spiritual exercises you prescribe?"</p>

<p>Teacher: "To make sure you are not asleep when the sun begins to rise."</p>
</blockquote>
