The New York Times [recently reported](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/17/talk-deeply-be-happy/?src=me&amp;ref=general) on a study published in <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2010/02/17/0956797610362675.full"><em>Psychological Science</em></a> suggesting that people who engage in substantive, meaningful conversations are happier than those who do not.

It appears that Mill was right â€” it is better to be a dissatisfied Socrates than a satisfied pig.
