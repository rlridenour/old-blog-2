<p>I haven't had much time to post anything recently. I've been busy getting to know my 250 new soldiers. We have had some gorgeous weather lately. Lows have been in the high 60's with highs in the low 90's. It definitely feels cool in the mornings. I'm scheduled to go home on leave in January. I'm not sure if I can survive the cold Oklahoma wind in January after seven months in the desert.</p>
<p>I am grateful to everyone who has sent supplies and goodies for the troops. Westwood Elementary (The Hippest School in America) sent us a huge box recently! I've asked them for a special gift: decorations for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I'm looking forward to what the kids can create to decorate our headquarters. I'll be sure to take some pictures and post them on the blog.</p>
<p>Continue to pray for us. We have some people who are dealing with some tough issues. May God continue to watch over us all.</p>
