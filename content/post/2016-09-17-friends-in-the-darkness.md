I'm sitting in the USO at the Portland airport with some time to write the prayer for the week. The week of 9/11 is always a time of reflection for me. In past years, I've generally thought about the cost to military families, compared to a country that mostly feels inconvenienced at the airport. This year, I thought instead about the wonderful friends I made during two deployments. Although I do wish that the conflict had never happened, those friends are gifts from God that I will always cherish.

This week's prayer:

Thank you for  
the precious ones  
who walk through  
the valleys with us,  
surrounding us  
with your love,  
and reminding us   
that your grace can  
redeem every moment.  

*Amen*
