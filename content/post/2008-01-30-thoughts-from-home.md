<p>Being home has been wonderful, but it has also been difficult in ways. I found out that someone read a comment that I left on someone's blog and has tried to stir up controversy. Over the past seven months, I have been shot at, bombed, attacked with rockets and mortars, and almost shot down in a helicopter. I have seen things that are still too painful to recount, things that I have not discussed in this blog. None of these things have been as painful as this incident has been.<br />
Without going into much detail, I claimed that a certain position was indefensible. Instead, of jumping to conclusions, I wish that I had been asked what this claim meant and why I held it. If I had been asked, I could have explained that this position, in its strongest form, entails that there is no age of accountability, and that infants who die are condemned to damnation. This is what I find indefensible. I believe that a loving God will save those who die, including infants and the severely mentally handicapped, that do not have the capacity to understand, believe, and accept the Gospel. I know of people who disagree with me, but I don't think that my position is out of the mainstream in Baptist life.<br />
I have many dreams for the church. I dream that someday we will finally reach the point where we welcome open dialogue. I dream that we will become people who do not rush to judgment when someone appears to disagree, but instead seek first to understand. I dream that we will use disagreement as an opportunity to grow and be challenged, instead of merely being offended. Finally, I dream of the day when our love for each other becomes a sign of our discipleship. Instead, sadly enough, our attitudes toward each other are too often simply a sign of our religion. Pray for peace...</p>
