Prayer for All Saints Day

Lord, 

We search for heroes   
among the rich, powerful,   
strong and proud â€”   
those who look more   
like the crucifiers   
than the crucified. 

But on this day,  
we give thanks   
for those for whom   
loving is more important  
than being loved,   
and faithfulness more   
dear than fame. 

Not our idols,   
instead, your saints. 

*Amen*
