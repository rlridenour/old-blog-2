<p>I recently attended a screening of an interesting documentary, <em>Meeting Resistance. </em>A British and and an American interviewed a dozen insurgents about their reasons for fighting the Americans. One thing that is clear upon watching the film is the difficulty of combating an insurgency that is composed of small, relatively independent cells. Another difficulty is countering the insurgents' message that the Americans are simply an army of occupation. That makes winning popular support for the coalition and the Iraqi security forces more difficult.</p>
<p>The good news is that, in September, U.S. casualties were the lowest they have been in over a year, and Iraqi civilian deaths were down 50 percent from the previous month.</p>
<p>Even so, the conflict goes on. A warrant officer and I were walking back from the film when a rocket attack hit. Trust me, hearing a rocket going through the air over your head is an unforgettable experience.</p>
<p>Pray for peace...</p>
