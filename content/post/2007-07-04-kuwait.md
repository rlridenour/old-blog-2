<p>After about 24 hours of travel time (flying, waiting in terminals, etc.), we arrived in Kuwait. We will be here for nearly two weeks. It is hot, sandy, with more heat and a little (no, a lot) more sand. I wish I could describe how it looks. There are no trees, no grass, no vegetation at all. There is just sand. We have had a sandstorm for two days now. I feel like a bit player in an old Foreign Legion film.</p>
<p>I don't have the capability to post pictures yet. When I do, I'll be sure to put some up of the beautiful surroundings.</p>
<p>I did see two herds of camels on the drive in, though. That was fun.</p>
<p>Blessings...</p>
