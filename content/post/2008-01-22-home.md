<p>After three days of traveling, I arrived home yesterday evening. I sure have missed Sheri and Rachael, but I didn't know how much I've missed other things also. Those are things like having a bathroom in the same building as your bedroom, showers that are big enough to turn around in, and being able to just jump in the car and drive anywhere you like. We don't have any big plans for the next two weeks. I'm going to OBU on Friday. If any of you are in town this week, it would be nice to see you.Â </p>
