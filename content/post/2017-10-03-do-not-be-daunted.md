I bought an entire book for these two paragraphs, but they are worth much more than I paid:

>"Rabbi Tarfon would say:

>You are not obligated to complete the work,  
>but neither are you free to abandon it.

>Do not be daunted  
>by the enormity of the world's grief.
>Do justly, now,  
>Love mercy, now.  
>Walk humbly, now."[^1]
