A hundred mile journey  
from Nazareth to Bethlehem,  
taken at the whim  
of the emperor. 

And two people,  
who never counted to Caesar,  
walked for days  
to be counted by Caesar.

But Caesar rested easily in his palace,  
not feeling the earth tremble  
as the weight of the universe  
was laid in a manger.
