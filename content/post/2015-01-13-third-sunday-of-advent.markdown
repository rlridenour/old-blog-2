This is a prayer I wrote for the Christmas special at NorthHaven Church today:

Holy God,

Once again,  
the angels invite us  
to come,  
behold,  
and adore.

Now may your spirit of peace  
quiet our minds,  
prepare our hearts,  
and open our eyes  
this Christmas season  
that we may see  
the beauty of the Savior  
as if for the very first time.

And then, as we run to Bethlehem in joy  
to worship the newborn King,  
may we do so  
knowing that the tiny arms  
that reached out to Mary  
are the same arms that were stretched out  
to redeem the world;

And the song that the angels sang  
is but a shadow of the one  
that all creation will sing  
in the world to come:

Gloria in excelsis Deo,

Glory,  
Glory,  
Glory to God in the highest!

*Amen*
