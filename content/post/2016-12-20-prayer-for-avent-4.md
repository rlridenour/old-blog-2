Father of Light,

The creator of the universe  
came to us as a helpless child,  
reminding us that there is no  
reconciliation without risk  
or love without a chance of loss.

But we sacrificed peace  
on the altar of security,  
preferring to remain in darkness  
than to venture out into the light,  
desiring our kingdom more than yours.

Give us the courage  
to drop our guard,  
and open our lives  
both to you and  
to one another.

*Amen*
