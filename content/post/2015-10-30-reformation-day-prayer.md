God of grace,

On the door of the church,  
Luther proclaimed his message,

"The true treasure of the church  
is the most holy gospel  
of the glory and grace of God."

A treasure too great  
to be kept to ourselves,  
yet why is that  
we who have received  
so much grace somehow  
seem to have so little  
left to offer?

Forgive me, Lord,  
and let me never again  
confuse your river of grace  
with the cesspool of  
my self-righteousness.

*Amen*
