<p>I haven't posted anything in a few days. I can't access any blog sites from the office computer. They are all blocked. I'm not sure why, but it might be to minimize the possibility of anyone reading Bruce Prescott's blog on a government machine. They just don't realize that a little subversiveness is always good for the country. It does make it difficult to post anything new. By the time I get back to the CHU (that stands for "Containerized Housing Unit" which is Army jargon for "trailer." It's pronounced "choo" as in "choo-choo train." It sounds like a nursery rhyme: "I knew an old man who lived in a CHU.")</p>
<p>I've been writing grad school recommendation letters for some of my OBU students. You can take the year off and travel 7,000 miles, but you still can't get away!</p>
