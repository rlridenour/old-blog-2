<p>First aid training today... I learned how to give an emergency tracheotomy with a pocket knife, and I gave someone an IV. Only got to practice the IV on an actual volunteer. For some reason, no one would volunteer for the other procedure. Sheri knows that I have a queasy stomach, so I'm really surprised I managed to do the IV. It's one of those things that I'm glad I can do, but hope I never have the chance.</p>
