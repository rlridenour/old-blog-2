![Humvee Altar](/assets/img_0001-hmv-altar.jpg)

I went to a range where my soldiers were qualifying on heavy machine guns and light automatic weapons. Since it was Sunday, we had services at the range. I had to conduct several services with small groups as they were available. Here's a picture of the altar. I dropped the brushguard on our Humvee and placed the cross and communion cup on it. The sermon text was John 15:13, "No one has greater love than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends." Although I am a week late, it's a fitting text for Memorial Day. Pray for the families of those who have fallen, and for those who have been called to take their places.</p>
<p>Pray for peace.</p>
