title: Good News and Bad News

<p>As the old line goes, I have some good news and some bad news. The bad news first: it's boring. I'm on one of the largest bases in the country, and there is very little to do here. I was talking to one of my soldiers recently; and he said that it could be worse, we could be in prison. Then he said, "There's a wall around us, with barbed wire on top, and I don't do anything except work, eat, sleep, and go to the gym. Wait a minute, we are in prison!"</p>
<p>The good news, though, is that it's boring. Excitement, for a chaplain, is rarely good.  We have had no injuries, no casualties, and no need for crisis ministry in our unit.  As I've said in other posts, there have been some opportunities for ministry to other units, but we're doing fine.</p>
<p>As for the boredom, my DVD library in the office is doing a brisk business. I may regret tossing those western romance novels.</p>
<p>I found a bingo game in the office. I'm planning to have a bingo night in October, if I can get some nice prizes. If anyone would like to donate something, let me know.</p>
