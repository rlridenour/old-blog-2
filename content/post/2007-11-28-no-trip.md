<p>Test - Complete this sentence: The shortest distance between two points is ___________.</p>
<p>I got to the airfield to find out that the flight was canceled. Apparently, there were no other flights available. I'm not disappointed for two reasons. First, I found out yesterday that I would have to go up there in two weeks to spend a week or so. The base chaplain there is leaving and is not being replaced. So, a few of us will have to rotate in and out of there. Second, the return trip was to take two days. It would have been like flying from Oklahoma City to Dallas with an overnight stop in Mexico City.</p>
<p>If you filled in the blank with "guaranteed to not be your route when flying Army Air" you pass with "flying" colors.</p>
