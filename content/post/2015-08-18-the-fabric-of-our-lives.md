Loving Creator,

Each of us is a  
tapestry of threads  
furnished by others  
who were models,  
teachers, and guides.

And as our paths diverge,  
we take joy in this:  
those who came before  
are woven into the very  
fabric of our lives,  
each single thread  
a gift of your divine grace.

*Amen*
