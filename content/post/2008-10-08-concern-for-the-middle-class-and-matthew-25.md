<p>Both presidential candidates seem to be stressing the importance of adopting policies that are good for the middle class. I have to admit that such talk resonates with me, probably because I am a member of the middle class. Today, though, I saw a title of a <a href="http://www.sojo.net/blog/godspolitics/?p=2741">blog post</a> by Adam Taylor that is making me rethink my assumptions about the priority of the middle class.</p>
<p>It was titled "Just as You Did for the Middle Class, You Also Did for Me."</p>
<p>Ouch...</p>
