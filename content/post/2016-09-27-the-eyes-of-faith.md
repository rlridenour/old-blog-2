Creator God,

I gaze out from my fortress,  
and see a dangerous, hostile place,  
with dangers on all sides,  
forcing me to defend my territory  
against my many enemies.

Sometimes, I see a cold, unfeeling place,  
that demands that I care only for myself,  
since no one else will care for me.

Tell me what I would see, Lord,  
if only I could replace these  
grimy panes of doubt and fear,  
and see your creation through  
the clear windows of hope and love.

*Amen*
