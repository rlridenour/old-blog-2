Gracious God,

Thank you for the precious people   
who, quietly and humbly, have  
been the hands and feet of Jesus for us,  
who have celebrated our joys,   
wept in our sorrows,   
and sacrificed to help us   
become everything you   
have created us to be;  
each one a gift of love   
from your gracious hand. 

May we also be a gift to others,   
who need to see your grace, especially  
the many women around the world   
whose voices have been silenced,   
some, sadly, by the church herself.

Give us the grace   
to listen to those   
who are rarely heard,  
and to empower them  
to share their gifts,  
whatever they may be.

*Amen*
