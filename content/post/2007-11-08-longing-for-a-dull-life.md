title: Longing for a Dull Life

<p>Life has been interesting here lately. I'm never quite sure what I can post concerning attacks on the base. So, I'll just say that I spent part of a recent morning face-down in the dirt having some serious prayer time. Fortunately, there were no serious injuries. I am looking forward to going home where the most exciting thing that happens is when the pizza delivery man drives across my yard. There's much to be said for a long, dull life.</p>
<p>I was in Balad yesterday to visit a maintenance team. What a nice base! They even have a real movie theater that shows first-run movies. I think that team is going to have some serious issues soon; issues that will demand a ministry trip of several days.</p>
