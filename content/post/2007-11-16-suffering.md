<p>I know that most of America thinks that we are suffering horribly here. In the interests of full disclosure, I feel that I should reveal that tonight, every Friday evening in fact, is steak and lobster night at one of the dining facilities. The other dining facility has their steak on Wednesdays. There is occasional suffering though, sometimes there's no lobster, just crab legs.</p>
<p>I never thought war would be bad for one's waistline.</p>
