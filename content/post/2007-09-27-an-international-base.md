<p>One thing that's interesting is the number of different countries represented here. Americans are by far the most common. There are a large number of Australians stationed here, though. I've enjoyed talking to them. Other countries are represented by one or two. There are a few Brits, but most of them are stationed farther south. There are soldiers from central European and Central American countries. A Marine unit from the Kingdom of Tonga arrived recently. They sang in chapel recently and were very good.</p>
<p>There are also a large number of Indians, Filipinos, and Ugandans that are working on the base. It makes for some interesting dinner conversation in the dining facilities.</p>
