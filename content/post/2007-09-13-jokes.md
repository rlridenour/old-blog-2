<p>Sometimes, tensions can run pretty high at staff meetings. The staff officers work long hours and never get a whole day off. We each try to get away a half-day once a week, but that isn't always possible. When we mobilized in May, I began telling a joke or a humorous story at each staff meeting. My stories are pretty popular, and the presentation order quickly changed so that I closed the meeting. Unfortunately, these meetings have been going on now for four months, and I'm quickly running out of material. If you know any good jokes, feel free to post it below and help me out!</p>
