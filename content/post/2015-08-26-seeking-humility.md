The air is filled  
with the voices  
of those who want only  
to hear themselves speak.

Lord, teach me to hold my tongue.

Our minds are filled  
with thoughts of  
our next response,  
devastatingly witty,  
sarcastic, and biting.

Lord, teach me instead to listen.

Our eyes search  
for the one  
in the group  
whom we need to know;  
the one that will  
help us succeed,  
get ahead, and prosper  
in the eyes of the world.

Lord, draw me instead to those  
who are forgotten and ignored.

A gentle tongue,  
a generous ear,  
and a welcoming heart,  
create me anew  
in the image of Christ.

*Amen*
