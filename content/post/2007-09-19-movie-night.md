<p>We have organized a movie night here at the headquarters. There's not all that much to do here except work, eat, and exercise. There's not a real theater on the base, so we thought that watching a movie and having some popcorn will be good for people's spirits. My office had a big screen TV in it that I never used, so we moved it into one of the larger offices. That office has enough room to put in rows of seats, and I think that we will be able to accommodate everyone.</p>
<p>I had dinner last night with Chris Wallace, who attended OBU in the 90's. He's a horn player with the 3rd Infantry Division band. We had a very enjoyable time. The conversation made up for the food.</p>
<p>I have soldiers who are now home for their mid-tour R&amp;R leave. Pray that they will have a refreshing time with family and friends. I'm looking forward to my own time at home, but I don't think that will happen until January.</p>
<p>Blessings...</p>
