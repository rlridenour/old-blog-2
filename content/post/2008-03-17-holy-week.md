<p>Palm Sunday has passed, and we are moving into the most solemn period in the church calendar. As we enter this time of reflection concerning the sacrifice of Christ, think about these results of a recent poll by the Pew Research Center. Last August, 54% of Americans polled knew the approximate number of American military personnel that had been killed in Iraq, a percentage that had held steady since the beginning of the war. This year, the percentage has dropped to 28%.</p>
<p>Participants were asked to state the number of American military deaths in Iraq to the nearest 1,000. Only 28% of those polled knew the correct number. To date, nearly 4,000 Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines have died in Operation Iraqi Freedom.</p>
<p>What explains this sudden and drastic change in the awareness level of Americans? Apparently, as the economy spirals downward, the war is no longer the dominant issue in people's minds. Remember though, that we have sent, and continue to send, men and women into harm's way.Â  At least 4,000 of them will never return. We owe it them, to their families, and to our own children to never forget.</p>
<p>Pray for peace...</p>
