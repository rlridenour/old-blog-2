After reflecting on my time dancing during the service at Koinonia Baptist Church in Tamale, Ghana. There are pictures, there might even be some video.

God of joy,

Forgive me for the many times   
when what others were thinking  
was more important to me  
than expressing my praise to you.

Remove any inhibition  
that stands in my way,  
and may my heart be   
so filled with joy  
that I cannot help  
but to dance   
before the throne of God.

Amen
