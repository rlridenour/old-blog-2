<p>I am on a very large base in Baghdad. It was a hunting preserve of Saddam's, but he was probably only here 7 or 8 times total. My office is in a small trailer, where we provide cold bottles of water to soldiers and give them a place to relax. The cold water is important since the temperature is currently 118 degrees and will continue to rise through August.</p>
<p>Â I was going to attach a picture of the office, but I'm having trouble getting it to upload. We don't have the best access to the internet here. I'll get it sooner or later, I'm sure.</p>
<p>Blessings...</p>
