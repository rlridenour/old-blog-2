<p>After the desolate pictures of the desert in Kuwait, I thought you should see what difference some water makes. This is a picture from my last trip. We flew over this very nice date orchard and a few farms.</p>

<p> I was out running this morning when an explosion shook the ground. I think I set a personal best time for three miles. It's amazing what a little motivation can do.  It's also amazing how cool the air feels in the morning. The high is only 106 degrees today.</p>
<p>I can't believe that it's already Friday. Sunday is only two days away, and there hasn't been much time to prepare a sermon. The weeks are going by fast. We all hope that they continue to do so.</p>
<p>Blessings...</p>
