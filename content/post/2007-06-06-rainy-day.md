<p>Yesterday was a rainy day at the FOB. Rain is always a positive thing in Scripture, a sign of God's favor. Here, it has positive and negative aspects. Everything is muddy, and the rain comes through the open gunner's hatches on the vehicles when we are in a convoy. On the other hand, it is much cooler, and I'm sure that in a month, we will be remembering 70 degree temperatures with fondness. It's 109 in Baghdad today, and will be 117 on Saturday...</p>
